## 📖 Overview
The CI/CD pipeline is designed for a simple application consisting of a backend and frontend. It automates:
- Building and testing the application.
- Creating and pushing Docker images.
- Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Automated testing of code changes.
  - Code quality checks using `flake8` and `eslint`.

- **Continuous Deployment**:
  - Containerized application deployment using Kubernetes.
  - Automatic rollout and rollback on failure.

- **Dockerized Application**:
  - Backend and frontend packaged as Docker images.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana (optional)
- **Languages**: Python (backend), JavaScript (frontend)
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS EKS (or any Kubernetes cluster)

##  ⚙️ Setup and Usage
# 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-cd-pipeline-project.git`
`cd ci-cd-pipeline-project`

# 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the config/ directory and add the required environment variables. Example:

```plaintext
DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-dockerhub-password
```
# 3. Run Locally with Docker Compose
To test the application locally using Docker Compose:

Build and run the containers:

`Copy code`
`docker-compose up --build`

Access the application:
* Frontend: http://localhost:3000
* Backend: http://localhost:5000
  
# 4. Run Tests
Use the following commands to run tests for the application:

* Backend Tests:
`pytest tests/test_app.py`

* Frontend Tests:
`npm test tests/testui.js`

# 5. Deploy to Kubernetes
Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster and kubectl configured. Then, apply the Kubernetes manifests in the infrastructure/k8s/ directory:

`kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/`

## Verify the deployment:

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```
1. Monitor Logs and Status
View the pipeline status in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.
For Kubernetes logs:

`kubectl logs <pod-name>`
For Docker logs (local testing):

docker-compose logs
1. Stop Local Containers
2. To stop and clean up the Docker containers running locally:

`docker-compose down`
## 🔄 Workflows
1. Continuous Integration (CI)
`File: .github/workflows/ci.yml`
Triggers: Every push or pull request.
* Steps:
* Check out the repository.
*Run backend and frontend tests.
* Perform linting for code quality.

2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
`File: .github/workflows/cd.yml`
* Triggers: Merge to the main branch.
* Steps:
1. Build Docker images for backend and frontend.
2. Push Docker images to Docker Hub.
3. Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
